Right now, I plan to do these things in a step by step manner:

1. Optimize Backend Performance
    Instead of saving images temporarily (temp_image.png), process them directly in memory.
    Add a rate limiter to prevent excessive API requests.

2. Add SEO & Social Features
    Add meta tags (description, og:image, etc.).
    Use Google Analytics to track usage.





How to apply these features to my project ?
